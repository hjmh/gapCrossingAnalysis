# Gap Crossing Screen Analysis

Python code for analysis of pre-processed data from gap crossing silencing screen.

There are two ipython notebooks:
* _gapCrossing_analysisOfScreen.ipynb_  for comparing gap silencing phenotypes across genotypes
* _gapCrossing_detailedAnalysisOfGenotypes.ipynb_  for a more detailed look at the behavior of specific genotypes

Helperfunctions are defined in _gapCrossingAnalysisFunctions.py_.
